Words such as extra ______, high quality, masterpiece, ugly ______ are placebos. You can- most of the time- have a completely empty negative prompt and be fine.
Do not use emphasis unless absolutely necessary. (this:1.2), (that:1.3), (here:1.4), (there:1.5) can be detrimental to a prompt.
Do not make your prompts too long; imagine Stable Diffusion has a poor attention span, and writing too many words makes it miss things.
Focus on using e621 tags only if you can, especially when using EasyFluff.

When thinking about increasing the weight on a tag, think about this. A1111 reduces the weight of every other tag so that the average is still 1 - so you aren't really increasing the emphasis, you're decreasing the emphasis of everything else! Keep it to an absolute minimum. There are tags where it's warranted, especially low post count tags, but it's not common
You can end up reducing the weight of tags you want so much they are completely ignored if you go crazy with it
And if everything has increased weight, nothing does - it's getting averaged back to 1 anyways
